- academyName
- studentId - number or string
- study - method that writes in the console: The student firstName is studying in the academyName

Create two Student instances

## Task 4

Create DesignStudent, CodeStudent and NetworkStudent class that inherit from the Student class.

#### DesignStudent

- isStudentOfTheMonth - boolean
- attendAdobeExam - method that writes in console: The student firstName is doing an adobe exam!

#### CodeStudent

- hasIndividualProject - boolean (not settable, default is false)
- hasGroupProject - boolean (not settable, default is false)
- doProject(type) - method that accepts string. If the string is `individual` or `group` it should write that the person is working on the project of that type and set the value to `true` on the property of the project

#### NetworkStudent

- academyPart - number
- attendCiscoExam - method that writes in console: the student firstNAme is doing a cisco exam!
